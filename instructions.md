# Instructions

To use a command press `T` to get into chat. Then you need to start the command with a `/`.

If you don't know some commands do `/help`,

To move forward press or hold `w`, to move left and right press or hold `a` or`d`, and finally to move backwards press or hold `s`.

I got some stuff but where did it go? Press `e` to find out.
